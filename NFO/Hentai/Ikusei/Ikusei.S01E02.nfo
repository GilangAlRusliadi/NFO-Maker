	<plot>Following Mitsue’s advice, Miki stopped repressing her feelings for Masaki and began expressing them openly, without fear of rejection. This change did not lead to a typical teenage love story, but rather to a dynamic of domination and submission. Miki saw herself as a “queen” and transformed her relationship with Masaki, revealing her true dominant nature. Masaki, in turn, discovered his masochistic side. Their relationship intensified to the point of involving Masaki’s adoptive mother, who also had masochistic inclinations, enjoying mutual humiliation scenes. Miki’s childhood friend, now self-proclaimed “queen,” delighted in orchestrating and observing this power and submission play.</plot>
