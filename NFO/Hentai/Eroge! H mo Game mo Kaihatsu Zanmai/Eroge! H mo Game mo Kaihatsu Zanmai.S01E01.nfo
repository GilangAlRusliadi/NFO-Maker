	<plot>Mochizuki Tomoya, an otaku aficionado of eroges, is hired by the struggling eroge development company Flower, whose next production must turn a profit or else go bankrupt. He finds out that the employees of the company, Himeno Kisara, the chief artist, Fujiwara Momoka, the scenario writer, Kousaka Iori, the graphic designer, and Sunono Nene, the company president, are all virgins and have hardly any experience with eroges at all. The company office doesn't have functional air conditioning so during the summer everyone works wearing minimal clothing. One day, after everyone else has left the office, Tomoya looks over Kisara's artwork and finds that it is substandard and unrealistic, and so to improve its quality, he starts off performing actual sexual acts with her, so that she has reference for her artwork.</plot>
