	<plot>Today’s lesson is different than usual. It’s about the male and female body. Kenta is feeling a bit awkward because of the lesson’s content and Hana starts talking to him about it. Walking together after school, Hana brings up the topic of the lesson, and shows that she’s very interested in the difference between the male and female body. Kenta tries to change the topic but Hana forces him to show her his naked body once they get home.</plot>
