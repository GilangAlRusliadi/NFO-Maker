  <plot>The Ark Academy, chosen as a model case for inter-species school integration, saw the elf Aegis Thea Eaderlindt and her teacher head to the beach at her invitation. With her dignified and beautiful face, toned body, and ample chest, she attracted the gazes of men on the beach. Posing as the teacher's girlfriend to ward off pick-up artists, Aegis's attractive body made it impossible for him to suppress his desires. "This isn't Assistance, just a lovers' rendezvous..." With this pretext, the two intertwined their bodies passionately, knowing they would return to their usual relationship back at school. What are the hidden feelings of the elf knight under her cool demeanor? The blue sea, white sandy beach, the scent of the sea breeze... and the voluptuous guardian knight in a bikini.</plot>
