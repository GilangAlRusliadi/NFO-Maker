	<plot>A long, long time ago in the elven village, a book descended from the sky. The detailed accounts of elves who went out of the village are illustrated in it. For the elves who dwelt deep in the forest, this was an extremely terrifying discovery.  Horrified by what they saw in the book, the elves erected a barrier to cut all ties from the outside world. However, there will always be eccentrics among the elves.</plot>
