	<plot>After things heat up between Momoka and Ryota, she starts to feel embarrassed and begins avoiding him around the house. Ryota then hears a loud noise at the entrance—it’s Kanade, stumbling in, clearly drunk! With no other choice, Ryota helps her to her room. But as they reach her bed, Kanade, still tipsy, looks up at him and pleads, “Hey… you’ve still got some Touch Points left, right?”</plot>
