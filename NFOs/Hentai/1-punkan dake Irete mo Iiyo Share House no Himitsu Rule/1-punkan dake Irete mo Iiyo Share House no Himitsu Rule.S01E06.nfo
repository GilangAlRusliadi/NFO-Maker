	<plot>After the restaurant that Kanade works at becomes short-staffed, she desperately asks Ryota for help. To his surprise, he encounters a completely different side of Kanade—responsible, hardworking, and mature—far from the lazy person he knows at the share house. As the night winds down, Kanade serves Ryota a drink. But after some time, a tipsy Ryota finds himself getting closer and closer to her.</plot>
