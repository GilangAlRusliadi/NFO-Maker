	<plot>Shinji transfers to a new academy where he discovers he is the only boy. At first, he is alone and unable to make friends, but one day Hana, a classmate, approaches him, and they become friends. However, she soon reveals that she started talking to him because she belongs to a group that maintains “public morale” through sexual activities and, as part of her role, begins involving Shinji in sexual acts.</plot>
